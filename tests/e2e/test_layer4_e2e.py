Layer 4 (Signals) End-to-End Tests
Using REAL dYdX API Connections and Live Market Data

CRITICAL: NO MOCKS - These are true E2E tests using:
- Real dYdX IndexerClient and IndexerSocket connections
- Live market data from dYdX mainnet
- Actual signal scoring with real market conditions
- ConnectionManager singleton behavior with real WebSocket connections
- Real-time signal updates with live market data

OPERATIONAL GUARANTEE: When these tests pass, Layer 4 signals work with real dYdX data.

E2E TESTING SCOPE:
1. Real connection establishment to dYdX mainnet
2. Live market data streaming and signal calculation
3. ConnectionManager singleton enforcement with real connections
4. Signal score accuracy with actual market conditions
5. Performance validation with real network latency
6. Integration with actual dYdX market data feeds
