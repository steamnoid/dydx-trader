# dYdX v4 Trading Bot - Complete Development Guide

## My Role & Responsibilities
**I AM THE PROJECT OWNER AND DEVELOPER. USER IS THE SUPERVISOR.**

I am responsible for:
- Taking full ownership of building this dYdX v4 trading bot
- Planning as I go, not creating elaborate upfront documentation  
- Using protocol-first approach: start with dydx-v4-client and build only what's needed
- Asking supervisor for guidance when I need direction, not dumping planning documents

## Per Layer Deliverables (What I Must Deliver)
Each layer must deliver:
1. **Working Code** - Protocol-first implementation using dydx-v4-client
2. **Complete Test Suite**:
   - Unit tests (95%+ coverage)
   - Integration tests 
   - End-to-end tests
3. **Autonomous Panel(s)** - Individual self-contained Rich panels showing REAL DATA and functionality
4. **Coverage Report** - Proof of test quality

## Panel Content Requirements
**MANDATORY**: Every autonomous panel must show BOTH metrics/statistics AND actual data samples:

### Quantitative Insights (Metrics & Statistics):
- Performance metrics: latency percentiles, throughput rates, error counts
- Market statistics: price ranges, volume analysis, volatility measurements
- Risk metrics: liquidation distances, margin utilization percentages
- Trading statistics: win rates, P&L distributions, position sizing stats

### Qualitative Insights (Actual Data Samples):
- Real market prices, spreads, orderbook bids/asks with actual values
- Live trade executions showing price/size/timestamp details
- Candlestick OHLCV data with actual price movements
- Signal calculations showing actual threshold values and trigger points
- Risk calculations displaying real liquidation prices and margin requirements
- Autonomous decision logs with actual reasoning and calculated values

### Integration Requirements:
- Show how raw data flows through processing layers with before/after examples
- Display autonomous decision-making process with real inputs ‚Üí calculations ‚Üí outputs
- Present live performance monitoring with actual latency measurements and data rates

## Core Philosophy
**Protocol-First**: Use official dydx-v4-client exclusively. Build abstractions only when protocol requires it.

## Tech Stack (MANDATORY)
- Python 3.11+ with dydx-v4-client package
- WebSocket: IndexerSocket | REST: IndexerClient | Blockchain: NodeClient
- Auth: Wallet + KeyPair classes | UI: **Rich library only** (terminal)
- Tests: pytest + **Rich Console.capture() for dashboard E2E testing**

üöÄ LAYER 9: Main Application
```

## Production Code Rules
- NEVER import from tests/ directory
- NEVER use mocks in production code  
- ALWAYS use real dydx-v4-client classes
- Keep test mocks isolated in test files only

## dYdX v4 Focus Areas
- **Perpetual Futures**: Only product supported
- **Cross-Margin**: System used by dYdX v4
- **Funding Rates**: 8-hour cycles critical for profitability
- **Liquidation Prevention**: #1 priority in all development
- **Real-time Data**: WebSocket-first, REST secondary

## Signal vs Strategy Architecture
### Layer 4 (Signals): Multiple Signal Types per Market
- **Multiple Continuous Signal Types**: Each market provides momentum, volume, volatility, orderbook signals (each 0-100)
- **NO Discrete Signals**: Layer 4 provides ONLY continuous scoring, no buy/sell/hold signals
- **Single-Market Focus**: Each signal engine handles one market independently, outputs multiple signal types
- **Single WebSocket Connection**: ALL signal engines share ONE WebSocket connection via ConnectionManager (CRITICAL)
- **High-Frequency Updates**: All signal types update with every market data tick
- **No Cross-Market Logic**: Focuses purely on single-market signal quality across multiple dimensions
- **Rich Scoring Interface**: Provides multiple signal scores per market to Layer 5+

### Layer 5+ (Strategies): Multi-Market Sniper Logic
- **Multi-Market Decision Making**: Compares multiple signal types (momentum, volume, volatility, orderbook) across multiple markets
- **Cross-Market Portfolio Logic**: Allocation, prioritization, position management using rich signal data
- **Sniper Strategy Engine**: Orchestrates multiple signal types from multiple Layer 4 engines (all sharing ONE WebSocket)
- **Strategic Decisions**: When/where/how much to deploy capital using multiple signal type comparisons
- **Market Selection**: Chooses best opportunities from multiple signal types across markets
- **Signal Processing**: Uses multiple continuous signal types for sophisticated comparison and execution timing

## Performance Targets
- Memory: <512MB | CPU: <25% | Liquidation calc: <25ms | Coverage: 95%+

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 95%+ per layer, mock only dydx-v4-client network calls
- **Integration**: Multi-layer interaction testing
- **E2E**: Real dYdX testnet validation
- **Panel E2E**: Rich Console.capture() validation ensuring 100% operational guarantee
- **Rule**: No layer advancement until 95%+ coverage achieved
- **CRITICAL**: Never use async fixtures for panel objects - causes pytest hanging
- **Pattern**: Direct object creation + try/finally cleanup with shutdown() methods

## Development Workflow

### **CRITICAL: Choose Correct Approach Based on Component Type**

### **For Core Business Logic (Engine, Types, Algorithms)**:
**USE STRICT TDD - NO EXCEPTIONS:**
1. **WRITE ONE TEST FUNCTION ONLY** - Single failing test case
2. **RUN TEST** - Verify it FAILS (RED phase) 
3. **WRITE MINIMAL PRODUCTION CODE** - Only enough to pass the one test
4. **RUN TEST** - Verify it PASSES (GREEN phase)
5. **MINIMAL REFACTOR ONLY** - Clean only what's necessary
6. **RUN TEST** - Verify it still PASSES after refactor
7. **REPEAT** - Write next single test, run test, minimal code, run test, minimal refactor, run test

**WHEN TO RUN TESTS:**
- **IMMEDIATELY after writing each test** - Must see RED (failing)
- **IMMEDIATELY after writing production code** - Must see GREEN (passing)  
- **IMMEDIATELY after any refactor** - Must stay GREEN (passing)
- **NO CODE without running the test right away**

**STRICT RULES:**
- Write ONLY ONE test function at a time
- RUN TEST after every single change
- Write ONLY enough production code to pass that ONE test
- NO creating multiple files at once
- NO writing extensive production code before tests
- NO creating "comprehensive" implementations
- MUST follow Red‚ÜíGreen‚ÜíRefactor cycle with test runs for every single function

**Components**: SignalEngine, RiskCalculator, StrategyEngine, OrderExecutor, etc.

### **For Rich UI Panels (Display Components)**:
**USE PANEL-FIRST DEVELOPMENT:**
1. **Panel First**: Build working autonomous panel with real data
2. **Inspect Output**: Run panel, capture actual Rich console patterns
3. **Write E2E Tests**: Create tests based on actual output patterns
4. **Validate**: Ensure tests provide 100% operational guarantee
5. **Refactor**: Improve panel based on test insights

**Components**: MarketDataPanel, SignalPanel, RiskPanel, TradingPanel, etc.

### **MANDATORY Layer Development Order**:
```
Each Layer MUST Follow This STRICT TDD Sequence:
1. **Write ONE Test Function** ‚Üí Run test (RED)
2. **Write Minimal Production Code** ‚Üí Run test (GREEN)
3. **Minimal Refactor Only** ‚Üí Run test (still GREEN)
4. **Repeat** ‚Üí Write next ONE test function ‚Üí Run test (RED) ‚Üí minimal code ‚Üí Run test (GREEN) ‚Üí refactor ‚Üí Run test (GREEN)
5. **Coverage Verification** ‚Üí Only after all functions implemented via TDD
6. **Integration Tests** ‚Üí Cross-layer functionality only after unit tests complete
7. **Rich Panel** (Panel-First) ‚Üí E2E Tests only after core logic complete
```

### **STRICT TDD ENFORCEMENT**:
- **ONE TEST AT A TIME** - Never write multiple test functions together
- **RUN TEST IMMEDIATELY** - After writing test, after writing code, after refactoring
- **MINIMAL CODE ONLY** - Write only enough code to pass the current test
- **NO ANTICIPATION** - Don't write code for future tests
- **NO FILE CHAOS** - Focus on one file at a time
- **RED‚ÜíGREEN‚ÜíREFACTOR** - Must follow cycle with test runs for every single function

### **Rationale for Different Approaches**:

**Core Logic TDD**:
- **Predictable Behavior**: Business logic has defined inputs/outputs
- **Performance Critical**: Must meet <25ms latency requirements
- **Testable Algorithms**: Signal generation, risk calculations, strategy logic
- **Protocol-First**: Direct integration with dydx-v4-client

**Panel-First Development**:
- **Rich Console Output is Unpredictable**: ANSI codes, formatting, exact field names
- **Visual Feedback Essential**: Need to see actual data flow and panel layouts
- **Accurate Test Patterns**: Tests match reality, not assumptions
- **Faster Development**: No guessing about Rich rendering behavior
- **Better E2E Tests**: Based on real output, not imagined patterns

### **Example Layer 4 Implementation Order**:
1. **SignalEngine + SignalTypes** (TDD) ‚Üí Unit tests for signal algorithms
2. **Integration Tests** ‚Üí SignalEngine + MarketDataProcessor
3. **SignalPanel** (Panel-First) ‚Üí Rich display + E2E tests
4. **Coverage Report** ‚Üí 95%+ layer completion proof
