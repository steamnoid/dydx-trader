# ITERATION TRACKING - Methodology Development Progress

## CURRENT STATUS
**Iteration**: #8 (Stream-Based Methodology Focus)
**Date**: June 2025
**Focus**: Stream-based testing with Layer 2 real API recording and Layer 3+ replayed stream processing

## ITERATION HISTORY & LEARNINGS

### Iteration #1-6 (Previous Attempts)
**Problem**: Mixed methodology development with project implementation
**Key Learning**: Need clear separation between methodology and project goals
**Result**: Confusion about whether to complete dYdX or perfect methodology
**Decision**: Start fresh with methodology-first approach

### Iteration #8 (Current - Stream-Based Methodology)
**Goal**: Layer 2 provides real dYdX OHLCV data as reactive streams with recording capability; all higher layers use only replayed streams for deterministic testing
**Approach**: 
- Layer 2: Real API integration with stream recording
- Layer 3+: All tests use replayed streams, assert on stream data
- Stream-based testing replaces isolated unit testing
- Recording/replay enables deterministic, fast, reliable tests

## METHODOLOGY COMPONENTS BEING VALIDATED

### ✅ Established Patterns (Previous Learning)
1. **Strict TDD for Core Logic**: Red→Green→Refactor works for algorithms
2. **Build-First for UI**: Visual components need real output before testing
3. **One Problem, One File, One Fix**: Chaos prevention is essential
4. **Component Type Classification**: Different approaches for different components

### ❓ Currently Testing (Iteration #8)
1. **Stream Recording/Replay**: Can we reliably record real API streams and replay them deterministically?
2. **Stream-Based Testing**: Do assertions on stream data provide better test coverage than isolated units?
3. **Layer Separation**: Does Layer 2 (real API) + Layer 3+ (replayed) architecture improve testing?
4. **Integration Through Streams**: Can complex multi-layer systems be tested entirely through stream data?

### ❓ Still Need to Validate
1. **mitmproxy Integration**: Can we embed mitmproxy effectively in Layer 2 for recording/replay?
2. **Performance with Replay**: Do replayed streams meet latency and throughput requirements?
3. **Complex Stream Integration**: Can multi-layer reactive systems work with proxy-recorded data?
4. **Universal Proxy Patterns**: Are mitmproxy recording/replay patterns reusable beyond trading APIs?

## DECISION FRAMEWORK

### Continue Current Iteration When:
- Methodology validation is progressing
- Clear learning about universal patterns
- Forward momentum on instruction improvement
- Approach showing promise for reusability

### Start Fresh When:
- Methodology not being properly tested
- Stuck on project specifics vs. universal patterns
- No clear path to universal applicability
- Fundamental approach not working

### Current Decision Status: **CONTINUE**
**Reasoning**: Fresh start with clear methodology focus, good separation of concerns, AI ownership established

## LEARNING DOCUMENTATION

### What's Working Well
- Clear role definitions reduce confusion
- Methodology-first focus prevents implementation rabbit holes
- Instruction files as living documents allows iteration
- Component type classification guides approach selection

### Current Challenges
- Need to integrate mitmproxy for HTTP/WebSocket recording and replay
- Stream-based testing methodology needs practical validation with proxy
- Recording format and replay fidelity requirements for proxy-captured data
- Integration testing approach with mitmproxy-recorded streams needs definition

### Next Validation Steps
1. Install and integrate mitmproxy for HTTP/WebSocket recording and replay
2. Implement Layer 2: dYdX OHLCV stream recording with mitmproxy
3. Create replayed stream testing patterns using proxy-recorded data
4. Validate stream-based assertions vs. traditional unit testing with proxy approach

## METHODOLOGY SUCCESS METRICS

### Process Metrics
- **Instruction Clarity**: Can steps be followed without confusion?
- **Decision Speed**: Quick continue/restart decisions based on progress?
- **Learning Rate**: Are we gaining universal insights each iteration?
- **Chaos Prevention**: Is systematic approach preventing development chaos?

### Output Metrics
- **Code Quality**: High test coverage and working functionality?
- **Development Speed**: Efficient progress without rework?
- **Reusability**: Are patterns applicable beyond current project?
- **Documentation**: Clear instructions for future teams?

## CURRENT ITERATION GOALS

### Primary Objectives (Iteration #8)
1. Implement Layer 2: Real dYdX OHLCV stream with mitmproxy recording mechanism
2. Integrate mitmproxy for transparent HTTP/WebSocket recording and replay
3. Create Layer 3+ components that use only proxy-replayed streams as input
4. Validate stream-based testing methodology vs. traditional unit testing

### Success Criteria for This Iteration
- Layer 2 successfully records real dYdX OHLCV data as Observable streams
- Recording/replay mechanism works reliably and deterministically
- At least one Layer 3+ component uses only replayed streams for testing
- Stream-based testing provides better coverage than isolated unit testing
- Clear documentation of stream recording/replay patterns

### Failure Criteria (Restart Triggers)
- Methodology not being properly tested
- Focus drifting to project completion over methodology
- No clear universal patterns emerging
- Approach fundamentally not scalable

## NEXT ITERATION PLANNING

### If Current Iteration Succeeds
- Expand to more complex components
- Test methodology with different team member
- Document advanced patterns and edge cases
- Create methodology validation framework

### If Current Iteration Fails
- Analyze fundamental approach problems
- Simplify methodology to core essentials
- Test on even simpler validation project
- Reconsider basic assumptions about approach

## METHODOLOGY EVOLUTION TRACKING

### Instruction File Changes This Iteration
- Created METHODOLOGY_OWNERSHIP for clear process control
- Separated universal patterns from project specifics
- Added decision framework for iteration management
- Established AI as process owner with clear authority

### Expected Changes Next Iteration
- Document stream recording/replay library selection and usage patterns
- Refine stream-based testing methodology based on real implementation
- Add performance validation patterns for recorded/replayed streams
- Update universal patterns to include stream recording/replay architecture

The goal is methodology that works universally, not just for dYdX.
