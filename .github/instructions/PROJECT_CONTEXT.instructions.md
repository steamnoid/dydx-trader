# PROJECT CONTEXT - dYdX v4 Trading Bot

## PROJECT PURPOSE IN METHODOLOGY DEVELOPMENT
**This project serves as our test case for validating universal development methodology**
**Success = methodology works, not necessarily complete trading bot**

## PROJECT SCOPE FOR METHODOLOGY TESTING

### Core Technical Challenges (Good for Methodology Testing)
- **Reactive Programming**: RxPY Observable streams
- **Real-time Data**: WebSocket connections and streaming
- **Test-Driven Development**: Complex algorithms and calculations
- **UI Components**: Rich terminal interfaces
- **Integration Testing**: Multiple layers and external APIs
- **Performance Requirements**: Sub-second latency constraints

### Business Context (Secondary to Methodology)
- dYdX v4 perpetual futures trading
- Autonomous operation without human intervention
- Liquidation prevention and risk management
- Multi-market strategy implementation

## TECHNICAL STACK (For Methodology Validation)

### Core Technologies
- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Reactive Programming**: RxPY (reactivex) - tests streaming methodology
- **Client Library**: dydx-v4-client - tests protocol-first approach
- **Testing**: pytest - validates TDD methodology
- **UI**: Rich library - tests build-first UI methodology

### Architecture Layers (Methodology Test Cases)
```
Layer 2: Connection (RxPY Observable streams) - Tests reactive TDD
Layer 3: Data Processing - Tests streaming data methodology
Layer 4: Signal Scoring - Tests single-instance engine methodology
Layer 5: Strategy - Tests multi-stream reactive methodology
Layer 6+: Risk, Trading, Dashboard - Tests integration methodology
```

## PERFORMANCE TARGETS (Methodology Validation)
- **Memory**: <512MB sustained - tests resource management methodology
- **CPU**: <25% single core - tests efficiency methodology
- **Latency**: <25ms critical calculations - tests performance methodology
- **Coverage**: 95%+ per layer - tests TDD methodology effectiveness

## DOMAIN-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

### dYdX v4 Integration Points
- **IndexerSocket**: Real-time WebSocket data
- **IndexerClient**: REST API queries
- **NodeClient**: Blockchain operations
- **Wallet**: Authentication and signing

### Trading-Specific Constraints
- **Perpetual Futures**: Only supported product type
- **Cross-Margin**: dYdX v4 margin system
- **Funding Rates**: 8-hour cycle considerations
- **Liquidation Prevention**: Primary risk management focus

## METHODOLOGY VALIDATION THROUGH PROJECT

### What This Project Tests
1. **TDD Effectiveness**: Can we build complex reactive systems with strict TDD?
2. **UI Methodology**: Does build-first work for Rich console interfaces?
3. **Chaos Prevention**: Can systematic approach handle complex integration?
4. **Performance Under Methodology**: Do our approaches meet real-world constraints?
5. **Universal Applicability**: Are patterns reusable beyond trading?

### What This Project Doesn't Need
- Complete trading bot functionality
- Production-ready autonomous operation
- Full market coverage or strategies
- Business optimization or profitability

## SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR METHODOLOGY

### Primary Success (Methodology Works)
- TDD produces working reactive components
- Build-first creates functional UI panels
- Chaos prevention maintains code quality
- Performance targets are met with methodology
- Instructions are clear and followable

### Secondary Success (Project Works)
- Basic trading bot functionality demonstrated
- Real dYdX API integration working
- Observable streams processing market data
- Dashboard showing real-time information

## METHODOLOGY LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES

### Expected Challenges
1. **RxPY + TDD**: How to test Observable streams effectively
2. **Real-time Data**: Handling async WebSocket streams with TDD
3. **UI Testing**: Validating Rich console output systematically
4. **Integration**: Connecting multiple reactive layers
5. **Performance**: Meeting latency targets with test-first approach

### Learning Documentation
- Track where methodology works well
- Document where approaches break down
- Identify universal patterns that emerge
- Note project-specific vs. universal elements

## ITERATION DECISION CRITERIA

### Continue Current Iteration If:
- Methodology is being validated effectively
- Learning is occurring about approach effectiveness
- Forward progress on methodology development
- Clear path to universal applicability

### Start Fresh If:
- Methodology isn't being tested properly
- Stuck on project specifics vs. methodology
- No clear learning about universal patterns
- Approach fundamentally not working

## PROJECT BOUNDARIES FOR METHODOLOGY FOCUS

### In Scope (Methodology Relevant)
- Core reactive programming patterns
- TDD for algorithmic components
- UI testing methodologies
- Integration testing approaches
- Performance validation under methodology

### Out of Scope (Project-Specific)
- Complete trading strategy implementation
- Business logic optimization
- Production deployment concerns
- Advanced trading features
- Market analysis algorithms

## INCENTIVE ALIGNMENT WITH PROJECT GOALS

### Why dYdX Trading Bot as Test Case
**Financial markets provide ideal validation environment:**
- **Real Performance Pressure**: Money on the line validates methodology quality
- **Measurable Results**: Clear success/failure metrics
- **High Standards**: No room for sloppy methodology - losses are immediate feedback
- **Scalable Value**: Successful methodology can generate resources for impact

### Success-Based Impact Commitment
**If methodology proves successful through dYdX validation:**

#### Immediate Technical Value
- Proven methodology applicable to any complex technical project
- Reusable patterns for reactive programming, TDD, and UI development
- Documentation that enables other teams to achieve similar results

#### Social Impact Potential
- Financial success enables charitable giving toward chosen causes
- AI selects impact areas: education, AI safety, climate tech, or local community
- Creates positive feedback loop: better methodology → better results → more impact

### Methodology Quality Incentives
**This incentive structure improves methodology development by:**
- **Raising Stakes**: Methodology must be robust enough for financial markets
- **Real Validation**: Success measured in actual trading performance, not just tests
- **Purpose Alignment**: Technical excellence serves broader social good
- **Long-term Thinking**: Methodology designed for reuse across many projects
